# awesome wm systray switcher

Since apparently X11 doesn't let you have the systray in two or more monitors at the same time, this snippet moves the systray to the focused screen. (Afaik, it can't be done with signals).

## Installation
Copy the code snippet into your `rc.lua` config file.

## Configuration
Modify `timeout = 0.5` with the timeout that works for you. (In seconds).
